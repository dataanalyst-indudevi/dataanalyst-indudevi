Data Analyst – Indu Devi

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Mathematics and a practical interest in data analytics, business intelligence, and problem-solving. I work with tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python to extract insights, clean and analyze datasets, and build dashboards that support decision-making.
